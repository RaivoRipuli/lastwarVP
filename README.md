# lastwarVP

## How to use
1) Install AutoHotkey (default settings)
2) Start the game with a defined resolution (_LastWar.exe -screen-height 1024 -screen-width 1080_)
3) Open the "Title Assignment" view
4) Run the AutoHotkey script (_autoVP.ahk_)
6) It will start automatically after two seconds
7) You can terminate it by holding "q"

## TODO

1) Test how it works when capitol occupiers leave (menu order changes)
2) Use pixel color as conditions (perhaps too fancy)

## Testing done

1) PM
2) Zero
3) Someone applies for VP
4) Running for a whole day
